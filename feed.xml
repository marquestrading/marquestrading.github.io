        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first step towards becoming a consistent trader involved defining my edges. Most readers of this blog already know what an ‘edge’ is but for the non-traders: an edge is just a condition which indicates a higher probability of something occuring. When I see the condition I place my bet. Here are the results of my 4 defined edges so far which I have been testing during the T20 blast and CPL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Num of matches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;256%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-93%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-86%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-71%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to be clear: £10 trades on Edge 2 would have resulted in a loss of £9.3 after 10 matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will test each edge for 20 matches before deciding whether it is profitable. The good news is that Edge 1 seems promising. It is quite rudimentary at this stage and I have a few ideas on how to improve it. I am currently trading with only £2 bets but I will soon start increasing my bet amounts. The advantage of defining my edges and trading rigidly with them is that I am no longer stressed. I am able to take a loss just as easily as a win. You might argue that I have no right to be stressed when Im only staking £2! But you get the idea. Edges 2, 3 and 4 are not doing well yet but there is still a long way to go before I judge them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, the CPL has taken a slight toll on me. I stay up trading late into the night, find it hard to sleep and then I dream about cricket in my sleep. While I enjoy cricket I certainly dont want to dream about it. So from next week, I will switch my focus to the West Indies v India test matches which are during far more reasonable hours.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome - My journey to become a Consistent Trader</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my first post. Just to introduce myself: In 2006 I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Science and found a job at a large corporation. Pretty soon I realised that this was not my scene. Whilst I enjoyed some parts of the job, I really despised the corporate culture - climbing the ladder, dealing with office politics etc. I could go on and on. So I started thinking about my future and came to the realisation that I wanted to work for myself or start a technology company. The problem - I had no decent or even semi-decent ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, I would really enjoy watching sports and having an odd bet from time to time. In January 2015, I stumbled upon Betfair cricket markets and was stunned by the amount of money exchanged over a game of cricket. After doing some research I found that there were quite a few ‘Cricket Traders’ who made a comfortable living doing this. I really love cricket and betting - I wanted a piece of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I convinced myself that this would be quite easy. After all, I had grown up playing cricket and I watched a lot of it on TV. But how &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; was I? In the following 12 months, I found that if I backed the batting team a wicket would fall, if I sensed a wicket I was too scared to back the bowling team; I would chase losing positions so as to avoid ending the day with a loss. The market was contrived to take my money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I read ‘Trading in the Zone’ by Mark Douglas. The book resonated with me so much that I read it twice, then a third time and I took notes. I have tried to internalize Mark’s concepts and focus on his principles of having a probabilistic mind-set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, I quit my job to trade sports full time. I have given myself three years to crack this. This blog will document my journey from a novice trader to hopefully a consistent one.&lt;/p&gt;
