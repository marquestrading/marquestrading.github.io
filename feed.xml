        <title>First test match</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I traded my first full test match: India v West Indies. I usually enjoy watching test matches but at times I struggled to sit through this test. India dominated from start to finish and the market was relatively stagnant. After 4 days, I lost a bit of money but overall I learnt quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I traded this test?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of every day, I did my research and thought about the various ways the day’s play could unfold. For the first 2 days I traded relatively well but things went downhill from there. Mid-way through the first session on Day 3, I backed the draw. The draw price was crashing and I expected myself to get out with a nice profit during the lunch break, except…Bravo decided to get out at the stroke of lunch. Just after lunch, Shami picked up 2 wickets in one over and I was a dead duck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am more disappointed in myself for the way I traded the remainder of the test match. I backed the draw at high prices and kept waiting for a little bit of a fightback in anticipation of green-ing out. This was always quite dangerous given that all 5 of the Indian bowlers were bowling very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, I probably lost money due to the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bit of bad luck with the wicket of Bravo on Day 3. However, if presented the same situation I will trade the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of bad trading on Days 3 and 4. Given that the Indian bowlers bowled well, I should have been more wary of backing the draw and if I did back the draw, I should have dipped in and out of the markets looking for small profits rather than large ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over-estimating the West Indies. I know this is a poor West Indies team but I expected a bit of fightback at some stage, and this didnt eventuate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am much better for going through the first test. I am really looking forward to the 2nd test starting tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitch is green and the last 15 matches at Jamaica have not seen a draw. So I am going to back the bowling team tomorrow and lay the draw when possible. I think a green pitch might favour the West Indies slightly in that it will bring their bowlers more into play (Brathwaite and Holder looked especially toothless in the first test). And I hope we see a bit of Alzarri Joseph!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I dont intend to turn this into a profit/loss blog, I might attach screenshots from time to time:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first step towards becoming a consistent trader involved defining my edges. Most readers of this blog already know what an ‘edge’ is but for the non-traders: an edge is just a condition which indicates a higher probability of something occuring. When I see the condition I place my bet. Here are the results of my 4 defined edges so far which I have been testing during the T20 blast and CPL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Num of matches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;256%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-93%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-86%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Edge 4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-71%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to be clear: £10 trades on Edge 2 would have resulted in a loss of £9.3 after 10 matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will test each edge for 20 matches before deciding whether it is profitable. The good news is that Edge 1 seems promising. It is quite rudimentary at this stage and I have a few ideas on how to improve it. I am currently trading with only £2 bets but I will soon start increasing my bet amounts. The advantage of defining my edges and trading rigidly with them is that I am no longer stressed. I am able to take a loss just as easily as a win. You might argue that I have no right to be stressed when Im only staking £2! But you get the idea. Edges 2, 3 and 4 are not doing well yet but there is still a long way to go before I judge them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, the CPL has taken a slight toll on me. I stay up trading late into the night, find it hard to sleep and then I dream about cricket in my sleep. While I enjoy cricket I certainly dont want to dream about it. So from next week, I will switch my focus to the West Indies v India test matches which are during far more reasonable hours.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome - My journey to become a Consistent Trader</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my first post. Just to introduce myself: In 2006 I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Science and found a job at a large corporation. Pretty soon I realised that this was not my scene. Whilst I enjoyed some parts of the job, I really despised the corporate culture - climbing the ladder, dealing with office politics etc. I could go on and on. So I started thinking about my future and came to the realisation that I wanted to work for myself or start a technology company. The problem - I had no decent or even semi-decent ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, I would really enjoy watching sports and having an odd bet from time to time. In January 2015, I stumbled upon Betfair cricket markets and was stunned by the amount of money exchanged over a game of cricket. After doing some research I found that there were quite a few ‘Cricket Traders’ who made a comfortable living doing this. I really love cricket and betting - I wanted a piece of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I convinced myself that this would be quite easy. After all, I had grown up playing cricket and I watched a lot of it on TV. But how &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; was I? In the following 12 months, I found that if I backed the batting team a wicket would fall, if I sensed a wicket I was too scared to back the bowling team; I would chase losing positions so as to avoid ending the day with a loss. The market was contrived to take my money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I read ‘Trading in the Zone’ by Mark Douglas. The book resonated with me so much that I read it twice, then a third time and I took notes. I have tried to internalize Mark’s concepts and focus on his principles of having a probabilistic mind-set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, I quit my job to trade sports full time. I have given myself three years to crack this. This blog will document my journey from a novice trader to hopefully a consistent one.&lt;/p&gt;
