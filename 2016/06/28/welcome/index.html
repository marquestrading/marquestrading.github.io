	<div class="post-content"><p>Welcome - My journey to becoming a Disciplined Trader</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my first post! Just to introduce myself: In 2006 I graduated from University with a degree in Computer science and found a job at a large corporation. Pretty soon I realised that this is not my scene. Whilst I enjoyed some parts of the job, I really despised the corporate culture - climbing the ladder, dealing with office politics etc. I could go and on. So I started thinking very hard about what I wanted to do and came to the realisation that I wanted to work for myself or start a technology company. The problem - I had no decent or even semi-decent ideas.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I would really enjoy watching sports and having an odd bet from time to time. In January 2015, I stumbled upon Betfair cricket markets and was stunned by the amount of money exchanged over a game of cricket. After doing some research I found that there were quite a few ‘Cricket Traders’ who made a comfortable living doing this. I really love cricket and betting - I wanted a piece of the action.</p>

<p>I convinced myself that this would be quite easy. After all, I had grown up playing cricket and I watched a lot of it on TV. But how wrong was I? In the following 12 months, I found that if I backed the batting team a wicket would fall, if I sensed a wicket I was too scared to place a bet; I would chase losing positions by betting more money. The market was contrived to take my money!</p>

<p>Eventually I read ‘Trading in the Zone’ by Mark Douglas. This is the best book I have ever read. The book resonated with me so much that I read it twice and then a third time. I have tried to internalize Mark’s concepts.</p>

<p>In April 2016, I quit my job and I am now trying to become a disciplined trader. I will give myself 3 years to crack this. This blog will document my journey from a novice trader to hopefully a successful one.</p>

<p>I took my first step towards becoming a disciplined trader by defining 2 edges which I have tested over the last two months. Here are the results so far:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Edge</th>
      <th>Num of matches</th>
      <th>Profit so far</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Edge 1</td>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>2.68</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Edge 2</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>0.04</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
