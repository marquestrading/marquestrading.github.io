		<h1><a href="/2016/07/29/first-test-match/">First test match</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>Last week I traded my first full test match: India v West Indies. I usually enjoy watching test matches but at times I struggled to sit through this test. India dominated from start to finish and the market was relatively stagnant. After 4 days, I lost a bit of money but overall I learnt quite a bit.</p>

<p><strong>How I traded this test?</strong></p>

<p>At the start of every day, I did my research and thought about the various ways the day’s play could unfold. For the first 2 days I traded relatively well but things went downhill from there. Mid-way through the first session on Day 3, I backed the draw. The draw price was crashing and I expected myself to get out with a nice profit during the lunch break, except…Bravo decided to get out at the stroke of lunch. Just after lunch, Shami picked up 2 wickets in one over and I was a dead duck.</p>

<p>I am more disappointed in myself for the way I traded the remainder of the test match. I backed the draw at high prices and kept waiting for a little bit of a fightback in anticipation of green-ing out. This was always quite dangerous given that all 5 of the Indian bowlers were bowling very well.</p>

<p>With the benefit of hindsight, I probably lost money due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A bit of bad luck with the wicket of Bravo on Day 3. However, if presented the same situation I will trade the same way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of bad trading on Days 3 and 4. Given that the Indian bowlers bowled well, I should have been more wary of backing the draw and if I did back the draw, I should have dipped in and out of the markets looking for small profits rather than large ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over-estimating the West Indies. I know this is a poor West Indies team but I expected a bit of fightback at some stage, and this didnt eventuate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second test</strong></p>

<p>I am much better for going through the first test. I am really looking forward to the 2nd test starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>The pitch is green and the last 15 matches at Jamaica have not seen a draw. So I am going to back the bowling team tomorrow and lay the draw when possible. I think a green pitch might favour the West Indies slightly in that it will bring their bowlers more into play (Brathwaite and Holder looked especially toothless in the first test). And I hope we see a bit of Alzarri Joseph!</p>

<p>Whilst I dont intend to turn this into a profit/loss blog, I might attach screenshots from time to time:</p>
