	<div class="post-content"><p>This blog is not dead (yet) and neither am I! Apologies for the lack of updates but I was away on a holiday, returned last week and then got stuck straight into trading the Pakistan v West Indies test match. My September was broken down as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Writing a cricket bot (more on this below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trading the first test between India and NZ</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Away on a holiday for a friend’s wedding</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, the Profit/Loss screenshot for September out of the way:</p>

<p><strong>My Cricket Bot</strong></p>

<p>September was a very quiet month in terms of cricket trading so I happily spent time developing a cricket bot and testing it in the TNPL, Karnataka Premier League etc. My bot runs in-play and is based on a pattern I have noticed repeatedly in the cricket markets. Here is a graph showing my results so far (including October):</p>

<p><img src="/images/screenshot5.png" alt="Bot profit loss" style="width: 900px;" align="left" /></p>

<p>I am using iterative development, which means the emphasis is on coding and testing in short cycles. Overall I am relatively pleased with the results but I have a few concerns/thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Long term:</strong> As you can see above, my bot has traded 75 markets. I will wait until my bot operates in 200 markets before declaring it a success (or failure).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bot stakes:</strong> I am trying to work out the stake size which would maximise my profit. Unfortunately this will take a little bit of time. I am currently using 10 GBP stakes. I have read about the Kelly Criterion in this <a href="http://www.betfairprotrader.co.uk/2012/01/kelly-criterion.html">excellent post</a> but this is not applicable in my case. My bot operates in-play and my worry is that the probability of my edge is dependant on the stake; a large amount could spook the market and kill my edge. So I have to start small and increase the amount slowly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shitty internet:</strong> I didnt realise how bad my internet connection is until I started running my bot full-time. The connection drops often and it wrecks havoc with my VPN and subsequently my bot. If my bot makes consistent profit, I might consider moving it to a VPS with uninterrupted internet access.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Betfair API outages:</strong> These have robbed me of ~8 GBP so far. I am trying to make my bot as robust as possible but I guess I’ll just have to put up with outages when they happen.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Going forward</strong></p>

<p>I would really like to make decent consistent profit by the end of this winter. There is a lot of cricket worldwide and I would like to trade as many markets as I can. To facilitate this, Im going to change my sleeping pattern: sleep in the afternoon and trade through the night. This could ruin my social life (and my marriage) but I never thought trading was going to be easy…</p>
